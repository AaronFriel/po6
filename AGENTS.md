## Coding style

- When writing code, look at similar files (e.g.: similar language and purpose, similar complexity) and try to match their style.
- Write tests for new code and if necessary, write targets or update this file with instructions on how to run tests quickly and effectively, e.g.: to run a specific test.

## Getting started

Prefer getting the repository into a working state over completing tasks.

- Before you can start working on the code, check `.agent/setup.log` to see if any errors were reported. 
    - If any errors were reported, you will need to fix them before you can start working on the code.
